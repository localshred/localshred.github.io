In a world of tech blogs... why do we need yet another? We don't. So don't read this post. **No, seriously, you don't want to.**

Ok ok ok, please do. Wait, you're already here. Great, read on then!

> "Are you ready to rock?" » [Alive and well](http://tr.im/v1uv "Alive and well by Rise Against") by Rise Against from The Unraveling (before they sucked).

Once upon a time, I had a dream. That dream was to roll my own blog in [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org "Ruby on Rails") and show the world the awesomeness that was me. And so I bought [rand9.com](http://www.rand9.com "rand9 Technologies") with full intentions of launching my blog in a few days. Well, days turned into a week, a week into several weeks, several weeks into several months, etc.

At some point in the early going I realized I wasn't super close to deploying the blog, so I ended up building a simple static "Coming Soon" page (that did _not_ have an "Under Construction" animated gif), stating some important things about me, including the tagline which read: **"Coming Soon-ish"**. Needless to say, that "soon-ish" has been much more "later-ish" than I anticipated, to the tune of 9 months-ish. At least, I think it's been that long, maybe longer.

I won't go into details about the platform I'm now using, only that it's called **_Marley_** and it's super rad. I didn't roll it myself, but went with someone else's great idea and did a few mods here and there to suit my needs. I plan on following this post with a comprehensive look at _Marley_, and when I do I'll update this post with a link to that post. Whew.

I just want you _all_ to know (you know who you are) that I am [once again blogging]({% post_url 2009-07-18-just-to-complete-a-goal-people %} "Once again blogging: Just to complete a goal"), and this is my tech blog where I'll be adding programming/tech related content and keeping ya'll updated on the great projects I'm working on (yes, I do have a non-tech [personal blog](http://bjneilsen.wordpress.com "Inspiration & Insight by BJ Neilsen")). Till then, I bid you adieu.
